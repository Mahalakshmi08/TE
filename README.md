## ❕This repo is still under construction❕ 
so I'm sorry if anything is out of place or weird or anything, I'm still working on getting everything in the right place. Suggest improvements by <a href="https://github.com/MansiAyer/TE/issues/new/choose"> adding it as an issue </a>


**For Reference**
Most of the codes available can be found in the master branch. But in case it isnt, check the subject specific branch for any still-in-progress codes. But beware, the codes inside branches are usually there because they are still either being reviewed or are incomplete and need more changes.


 **For Contributions** 
<div> I'm under an MU-affiliated college so I'm uploading my curriculum. </div> 
<div> Contrubutions open, feel free to add your versions, or parts that are in your curriculum. Check out open issues if you're not sure what you can contribute to.</div>

<ul>
  <li> Fork this repo </li>
  <li> Go to the branch of the subject that you're contributing to. If it doesn't exist, create a branch with the subject name </li>
  <li> In the branch, go to the folder for the topic that you're contributing to. Example: if you're adding a crc code, go to Computer-Networks branch > Computer Networks > Cyclic Redundancy Check > drag and drop your file in </li>
  <li> If you've created a new subject branch, make sure to add a main folder with the subject name, then add your topic folder inside containing your file. I know it seems like a lot of steps but when updates from this branch are merged with master, they'll stay organised only if there is a proper folder system in place </li>
  <li> Make sure you credit yourself either in the file name or somewhere inside the file as a comment </li>
  <li> Make your pull request to add the branch to this repo. Do not add any files to main branch, that makes it difficult to keep master organised and maintained </li>
</ul>
<p>Please use appropriate folders and file names while contributing. </p>


**Branches**
<div> Master is final updates that won't have further updates. </div>
<div> All other branches are to make updates and edits for files under specific subjects.</div>
<div>For example, if I'm working on a new code for assembly, it goes under microprocessor branch. If the code is completed with no further updates required, a pull request is made comparing microprocessor branch with master so that all finalized files are updated to master.</div>
